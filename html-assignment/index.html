    <p>
        Hello,<br>
        I'm currently studying <abbr title="Interactive Multimedia Design">IMD</abbr> in 1<sup>st</sup> semester in Algonquin College and enjoying it so far.<br>
        My favorite courses right now is <em>Photography</em> and <em>Web development</em>, because i love taking photos and building a website.<br>
        Although we are only in early stage, i find it entertaining and fun to learn these courses. While studying, I'm also working as full time in<br>
        a hotel which i feel hard sometimes now that I'm doing both.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        My hobbies in my free time are playing computer games, working out and hiking. But at this season, i took a break in hiking and focus my time<br>
        in working out and studying. I love giving myself time in going to gym as i feel energetic and excited everytime I'm reaching a certain goal. <br>
        I also like watching anime, series and movies. My favorite movies of all time are <abbr title="Marvel Cinematic Universe">MCU</abbr> movies and my favorite anime is One piece,<br>
        it's about a character who's goal is to be a pirate king while traveling around the world together with his crews.
