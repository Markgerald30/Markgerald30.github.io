                Hello, I'm currently studying <abbr title="Interactive Multimedia Design">IMD</abbr> in 1<sup>st</sup> semester in Algonquin College and enjoying it so far. My favorite courses right <br>
                now is <em>Photography</em> and <em>Web development</em> because i love taking photos and building a website.<br>
                Although we are only in early stage, i find it entertaining and fun to learn these courses. While studying, I'm also working <br>
                as full time in a hotel which i feel hard sometimes now that I'm doing both.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                My hobbies in my free time is playing computer games, working out and hiking. But at this season, i took a break in hiking and focus my time<br>
                in working out and studying. I love giving myself time in going to gym as i feel energetic and excited everytime I'm reaching a certain goal. <br>
                I also like watching anime, series and movies. My favorite movies of all time are <abbr title="Marvel Cinematic Universe">MCU</abbr> movies and my favorite anime is One piece,<br>
                it's about a character who's goal is to be a pirate king while traveling around the world with his crews.
