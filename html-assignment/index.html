                Hello, I'm currently studying <abbr title="Interactive Multimedia Design">IMD</abbr> in 1<sup>st</sup> semester in Algonquin College and enjoying it so far. My favorite courses right
                now is <em>Photography</em> and <em>Web development</em>, because i love taking photos and building a website.
                Although we are only in early stage, i find it entertaining and fun to learn these courses. While studying, I'm also working
                as full time in a hotel which i feel hard sometimes now that I'm doing both.
            </p>

                <h4>My hobbies in my free time are:</h4>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Playing computer games</li>
                    <li>Working out</li> 
                    <li>Hiking</li>
                    </ul>
            </section>
            <p>
                But at this season, i took a break in hiking and focus my time in working out and studying. I love giving myself time in going to gym as i feel energetic and excited everytime I'm reaching a certain goal.
                I also like watching anime, series and movies. My favorite movies of all time are <abbr title="Marvel Cinematic Universe">MCU</abbr> movies and my favorite anime is One piece,
                it's about a character who's goal is to be a pirate king while traveling around the world with his crews.
