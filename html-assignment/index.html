        Hello,<br>
        I'm currently studying <abbr title="Interactive Multimedia Design">IMD</abbr> in first semester in Algonquin College and enjoying it so far.<br>
        My favorite courses right now is <em>Photography</em> and <em>Web development</em>, because i love taking photos and building a website.<br>
        Although we are only in early stage, i find it entertaininng and fun to learn these courses. While studying, I'm also working as full time in<br>
        a hotel which i feel hard sometimes now that I'm doing both.<br>
